Four applications I worked on during my training at Revature. 
The first one is a command line bank app where user's can login and deposit/withdraw money.
Two is a reimbursement web app that allows employees to log reimbursement request and managers to approve them.
Three is a trivia game where players can join a lobby and play against each other.
Four updated an existing web app from a monolith angular js application to a microservice angular 7 app.
